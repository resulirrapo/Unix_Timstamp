Task 1: 
Converted timestamp to seconds, minutes, hours.

Task 2:
Converted timestamp to a date without considering leap years.

Task 3:
Here we convert it while considering the leap years.

Task 4:
Converts the adjusted timestamp to both date and time in the specifed timezone.

Task 5:
Converts the date and time information back to a unix timestamp, while considering lep years.

Task 6:
Prints the date, time, and timezone information in a formatted string.

Task 7 and 8:
Here first we have some funtions that we use on both tasks like:
comparedate: Compares years, months, and days of two TDate structures.
unpackdate: Takes a packed date as input, extracts day, month, and year from the packed date using bitwise operations.
countbits:  Counts the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation used for a parity check in the later part of the code.
unpackdatesfrombits: Takes an array of unsigned ints and a bit position (bitStart) as inputs and thn unpacks a date from a specific range of bits in the array.

for task7: We start by allocating memory for unpacked and packed bits. The we read and store them in an array and then sort them based 
on year,month and day.

for task8: Task 8 has similar logic with task 7 except that we read packed and control data and then processes packed data based on control data for error checking. And then unpack and store valid dates in an array.

Task 9:
Here we have some functions that do the following
readtimezones: Reads the data from the input and populates the timezones array.
findtimezonebyname: Finds a timezone in the timezones array by its name and returns a pointer to it.
readpeople: Reads person data, including name, timezone, and availabilities, and populates the people array.
findfirstsuitabletimeinterval:Checks each person availabilities and verifies if the minimum number of participants can attend the event.
outputresult: Prints the names of people who can attend the event at the specifed time, considering timezones.
And on main we simply call the functions.
